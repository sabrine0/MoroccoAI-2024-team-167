Overview of the Real-Time Object Recognition with Audio Feedback:

This project is designed to perform real-time object recognition using a camera and YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection. It will detect objects in the camera's view, draw bounding boxes around them, display the object labels, and provide audio feedback for each detected object.

How it Works:

1. Camera Input: The script captures video frames from the computer's camera using OpenCV.
   
2. Object Detection: YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) is used for object detection. The model detects various objects in the frame, such as people, vehicles, or other classes trained on YOLOv5.

3. Detection Results: After detection, YOLOv5 returns a DataFrame containing information about each detected object:
   - "xcenter", "ycenter": The center coordinates of the bounding box (relative to the image).
   - "width", "height": The dimensions of the bounding box.
   - "confidence": The model's confidence in the detection.
   - name": The label or name of the detected object (e.g., "person," "car").

4. Bounding Box Calculation: The center-based coordinates are transformed into corner-based coordinates (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) to draw the bounding box on the image.

5. Audio Feedback: When an object is detected with a high enough confidence (above a set threshold), the system announces the object's label and confidence percentage using text-to-speech.

6. Display: The video frame is displayed with the detected objects' bounding boxes and labels.

7. Exit: The program will continue to process frames until the user presses the "q" key, which will stop the program.

 Requirements:

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

1. Python: The script is written in Python and requires version 3.6 or higher. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. PyTorch: YOLOv5 uses PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. Install it by following the instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

3. YOLOv5 Model: YOLOv5 is automatically downloaded via the "torch.hub.load" function. No manual download is necessary, but you will need an internet connection to fetch the model.

4. OpenCV: OpenCV is required for handling the video stream and image processing. Install it using:
  bash
   pip install opencv-python
 

5. Pandas: Pandas is used to handle the detection results in a DataFrame format. Install it with:
   bash
   pip install pandas
   

6. pyttsx3: This library is used to convert text to speech for audio feedback. Install it with:
   bash
   pip install pyttsx3
   

 Installation Steps:

1. Set up Python Environment:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can check by running python --version in the terminal.

2. Install Dependencies:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
   bash
   pip install torch opencv-python pyttsx3 pandas
   

3. Run the Script:
   - Save the Python script (e.g., Main.py) in your project folder.
   - Open the terminal, navigate to the folder where your script is located, and run:
     bash
     python Main.py
     

4. Using the System:
   - The script will start capturing video from your camera, detect objects, and provide audio feedback.
   - You can exit the program by pressing the "q" key.

Additional Notes:

- Ensure that your camera is properly connected and accessible by OpenCV. If there are issues with the camera feed, verify that the correct device index (0 is usually the default) is specified in the `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` method.
- The text-to-speech engine (`pyttsx3`) may require specific drivers or settings depending on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
